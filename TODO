 - Report messages for that fetch with that cookie.
 - Fetch
 - Cancel (cookie)
 - Cancel *

 Commands are processed as they arrive:
   - <fetch> => add to fetch queue
   - <fetch> => add to fetch queue
   - <cancel> => remove from fetch queue. If the fetch is in progress, take
     it down with a kill.

FooTV lifecycle:
   - Use a command queue that's processed by one thread that never blocks.
   - When shutting down, also kill the FooTV fetcher.

Allow FooTV to seek by turn.
