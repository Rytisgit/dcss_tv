FooTV
-----

FooTV accepts xlogfile entries from a TV request server (currently the
server hosting the Sequell bot on Freenode IRC ##crawl). When it
receives an xlogfile request, it identifies the server hosting that
game's ttyrecs, downloads the ttyrecs and plays back the game on
termcast.org, close to the end of the game, or close to the milestone
event if provided a milestone.

To run FooTV, use:

perl footv.pl

You'll first have to edit footv.pl to point at the server that
broadcasts TV requests.



FightClub
---------

FightClub accepts requests of the form "!fight X v Y", passes the
request to a slave Crawl process as "crawl -arena 'X v Y", and
termcasts the resulting arena fight.

To run FightClub, you need a local Crawl binary. Run FightClub as:

CRAWL_HOME=/directory/where/crawl/binary/lives perl arena.pl

FightClub runs its own IRC bot to take bot requests. Edit arena.pl to
configure the request bot. arena.pl forks an arena-slave.pl process to
run Crawl and termcast the fight. Edit arena-slave.pl to configure the
termcast channel, etc.
